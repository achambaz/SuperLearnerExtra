# SuperLearnerExtra #

This website contains a collection of wrappers that may be helpful for running `SuperLearner`. The package mostly contains wrappers from previous projects that are not general enough to be added to the main `SuperLearner` package but might be helpful as a reference or easily adapted to fit new projects. The package contains 3 folders, `SL`, `screen` and `method`. The `SL` folder contains prediction algorithms, the `screen` folder contains screening algorithms, and the `method` folder contains alternative methods (like NNLS()).

You can directly access each individual R script and copy the contents into your own SuperLearner script.
